# Advent of Code 2025 (C#)

Single-file C# solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/). Each puzzle lives under `dayN/taskM/Program.cs` next to its input file.

## Requirements
- .NET 10 SDK
- VS Code with the C# Dev Kit extension (for the Run/Debug CodeLens)

## Running a solution
- From the repo root run a specific file, e.g.:
  - `dotnet run day3/task1/Program.cs`
- Or open a `Program.cs` in VS Code and hit Run/Debug. No `.csproj` or solution file is needed because every task is a standalone C# source file.

Puzzle inputs are co-located with the solutions (for example `day3/task1/puzzle.txt`).
